My project for Code Louisville is a website for a cat rescue that highlights animals that are ready to be adopted. I wanted to create a website that put the focus on the animals and would make the proces of rescue simple and hassle-free. I have two adopted cats and would like to rescue/foster someday, so this project was a bit of an exploration into creating a website that could be streamlined and intuitive for people involved in that process.
